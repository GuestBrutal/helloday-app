## Project Goals
This project main goal is to reduce the number of victims of natural disasters by implementing an early warning system to increase awareness of the potential threats of disasters, especially among those who live in vulnerable areas. Another goal of this project is to make people aware of the disaster and how to manage it, not with panic that actually makes us not know where to go and maybe even do something that shouldn't be done when a disaster happens, this project soon will provide more information about the disaster, will give a map to avoid the disaster that may happen around us, because  basically there is no place is safe from natural disaster, for example is an earthquake.
