# HELLO DAY WEB APP

This project was created with React.

## Project Goals

This project main goal is to reduce the number of victims of natural disasters by implementing an early warning system to increase awareness of the potential threats of disasters, especially among those who live in vulnerable areas. Another goal of this project is to make people aware of the disaster and how to manage it, not with panic that actually makes us not know where to go and maybe even do something that shouldn't be done when a disaster happens, this project soon will provide more information about the disaster, will give a map to avoid the disaster that may happen around us, because  basically there is no place is safe from natural disaster, for example is an earthquake.

## Expected Outcome
* Increase the level of public awareness regarding natural disasters that may occur in the vicinity.
* Improving the quality of life of victims of natural disasters through donations.

## Succes Metrics
* The project can be completed by having all the features planned.
* The website has a responsive design so that it can be accessed from mobile or desktop.
* The system can provide warnings related to disasters with accurate data.

## Features
* Disaster Map

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
